# Team Charter

## Instructions

_Answer the questions below and fill out the process sections with your team’s mechanisms to follow your answers. Remove the italicized examples text as you go._

_On real world software teams, you will often create a document like this via a process called [reteaming](https://www.agilealliance.org/resources/experience-reports/dynamic-reteaming-how-we-thrive-by-rebuilding-teams/). Having something that captures the goals and concerns of everyone on a team helps the team work more efficiently together._

## Purpose

Highly performing teams have the following qualities:

* Psychological safety
* Dependability
* Structure and clarity
* Meaning
* Impact

Your team’s charter captures the ways in which your team will commit to providing and cultivating these qualities. Provide the information requested in this charter, but feel free to modify the formatting to best suit your team’s needs and style.

## Charter

### Team Members

- Ben Bagwell
- Mattison Pierce
- Scott Griffin
- Yosief Abraham

### Psychological safety

* **How can we take risks on this team without feeling insecure or embarrassed?**
  - Support each other in taking risks by being encouraging when someone is facing uncertainty

* **How do we address situations where any team member feels unsafe?**
  - If something seems wrong, and they aren't forthcoming, try to ask the affected team member in private (in slack or private messaging). If it seems like something the team can't address, let an instructor know.

### Dependability, Structure, Clarity

* **How can we count on each other to do high quality work on time?**
  - Communicate with team members in terms of everyone's progress, how each individual is handling their workload. If someone is overwhelmed, voice that and ask for help so the work can be more evenly distributed

* **How do we address missed deadlines?**
  - Talk about why it happened, if it's something that is urgent, redistribute workload. Possibly have a discussion about transparent communication to avoid missing deadlines in the future

* **How can we make goals, roles, and execution plans on our team clear?**
  - Daily standup and possibly listing the progress made at certain points throughout the day / brief check-ins in the middle of the day


### Goals

* **Overall: What is our overall objective for the Learn & Be Curious unit?**
  - Learn how to work as a team, rotate team member roles so that no one is stuck with something they're uncomfortable with but also has the opportunity to work in areas in which they fall short.
  - Learn how the elements of what we've been learning can combine to make a working product


* **Performance: What do we want to prioritize in terms of what we achieve?**
  - To have a working product that we feel good about presenting
  - We want to make sure everyone understands each section of the project regardless of who worked on what / make sure everyone would be able to present/demonstrate its functionality in clear terms if needed
  - Building a supportive professional relationship with teammates in which we feel comfortable both in asking for help and giving feedback/advice


* **Learning: What are the things that our team wants to learn?**
  - High level architecture/how each component communicates with the other
    - Understanding the full-stack
  - Understanding http requests, endpoints, curl, how information is transferred from one state to another



* **Task processes: What processes will our team follow to meet our goals, complete tasks, or to build team relationships?**
  - Rotate team roles
  - Having a concrete, regular meeting time in which we review and reflect on our goals and how they're developing
  - Keeping tickets updated
  - Regular code reviews that will help us develop our skills in constructive criticism

## Meaning & Impact

**What is personally important for each team member about becoming an SDE?**

* Ben: I want to be challenged in my work role
* Mattison: I want to work in a field that keeps my interest through frequent challenges and opportunities for learning
* Scott: I want stability and fair compensation for effort spent
* Yosief: I want to always be excited for the work I'm doing, to develop an expertise and be fairly compensated for it

**What each team member wants to achieve: e.g. improve analytical skills, learn project management skills, develop public speaking skills, speak up more, speak up less, etc.**

* Ben: I want to learn how to build and implement a full-stack architecture from the ground up
* Mattison: Develop time management skills, learn to speak up when I need help, and build understanding in API
* Scott: Build confidence in knowledge of full-stack architecture, how to build a product that non-programmers can understand and use
* Yosief: Learn communication skills and software development cycle/lifetime
